Json-db is a lightweight database for your node.js-powered app.

It uses an HTTP request to handle the data transfer and saves objects as `.json` files to your hard drive and comes with absolutely no dependencies. Pure Javascript. Yeah.

# A bit more detail please! #

Sure. Json-db is a fully RESTful json-only database. 
It stores items in collections, each collection can be seen as an JSON array.

## List All ##

With the basic namespace, a collection can be accessed this way:

    GET /node-js/collection

This will respond something like this    

    [{
      "foo":"bar",
      "_id","224810f50e57edef3bc048297e81"
    }]

## Push Item ##

To push a new row to this collection, simply send a POST with some JSON in it.

    POST /node-js/collection
    {"foo":"bar"}

Followed by this response

    {"push": {
	  "foo":"bar",
	  "_id","224810f50e57edef3bc048297e81"
	}}
